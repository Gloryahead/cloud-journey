# Cloud Journey – Day 1

## Overview
This repository tracks my 2-month accelerated cloud computing learning journey.  
The goal is to go from beginner to knowledgeable in cloud computing with hands-on projects.

## Day 1 – Cloud Computing Foundations

### Cloud Computing Summary
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing resources—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, platforms, and software—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go model. It allows companies and individuals to scale up or down quickly without building or maintaining their own physical data centers, saving time and cost. There are three main service models:

* **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** The provider manages the infrastructure, while the client manages the operating system, applications, and data (e.g., AWS EC2).  
* **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** The provider manages the infrastructure and runtime environment, and the client only manages their application code (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda).  
* **SaaS (Software as a Service):** The provider manages everything, and the client simply uses the software (e.g., Gmail, Salesforce).

### Real-world Applications
Cloud computing is widely used in industries such as:
* Banking and Finance (secure transactions, disaster recovery)  
* AI and Machine Learning (high-performance computing)  
* Storage and Backup (Amazon S3, Glacier)  

### Day 1 File
The `day1.txt` file contains my first cloud computing note and Git setup exercise.
